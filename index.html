            Circuit Acupuncture LLC was founded by Erin McCabe, a Board
            Certified (NCCAOM) and licensed provider under the Minnesota Board
            of Medical Practice. The foundations began when Erin was working
            on an acute care Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) rehabilitation unit
            and was receiving acupuncture treatments. During her graduate
            training, Erin spent one year as an intern at Courage
            <span id="vision"></span>
            Kenny Rehabilitation Institute providing acupuncture services for
            inpatient brain and spinal cord injuries. The theory of looking at
            our body as one large circuit resonated and so Circuit Acupuncture
            LLC manifested.
          </p>

          <h3>Vision</h3>
          <p class="long-copy">
            To promote balance in our surroundings by using minimally invasive
            techniques. To empower individuals to grow and create resiliency
            within their lives.

            Erin McCabe, founder of Circuit Acupuncture LLC, is a Licensed
            Acupuncturist with a background in healthcare. The early
            beginnings were as a nursing assistant with experience in nursing
            home, assisted living facilities, and memory care experience. She
            earned her Bachelor’s of Arts in Psychology from Metropolitan
            State University in 2010. Prior to starting school, Erin was a
            Psychology Associate on a Traumatic Brain Injury unit at Bethesda
            hospital. She was certified as a “Code Green” responder to
            adequately assess and manage an emergency situation of a combative
            individual.

            Erin had been receiving acupuncture for her own ailments since age
            twenty. She was recommended to watch the documentary 9,000 Needles
            and that started the journey towards pursuing a career in
            acupuncture. This complementary alternative therapy is a great way
            to help one’s body along the natural healing process.

          <h3 class="subcat">Acupuncture</h3>
          <p class="long-copy">
            Acupuncture is the technique of inserting extremely thin needles
            painlessly into the skin at various depths along specific points
            on the body’s meridian system using single use sterile needles. An
            acupuncture session takes approximately an hour, starting with an
            intake interview by the acupuncturist. The first visit will take
            longer, as the acupuncturist needs to gather symptoms information
            and ensure the client understands the procedure.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p class="long-copy">
            In classic texts, Acupuncture dates back to 2,000 years ago in
            China. Back then, as there were no iron casting available at that
            time, needles were “made of stone.” Today, acupuncture is widely
            recognized by allopathic and alternative practitioners around the
            world as an effective complementary healing practice. The efficacy
            of acupuncture has been well studied and documented. (See research
            links.)
          </p>
          <br />
          <p class="long-copy">
            Acupuncture can treat a variety of conditions. Overall,
            acupuncture is utilized to balance energy, ease pain, and help
            heal disease. Acupuncture is one of the fundamental techniques of
            traditional Chinese medicine. Acupuncture rebalances the energy
            flow, releases congested energy, and restores the body to its
            natural state of harmony.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3 class="subcat">Cupping</h3>
          <p class="long-copy">
            Cupping is a therapy in which a “cup” is attached to the skin
            surface to cause local congestion through the negative pressure
            created by introducing head in the form of an ignited material. In
            this type of cupping, commonly referred to as “fire cupping,” the
            glass cup is transparent to control the treatment effectively. The
            cupping method has the function of warming and promoting the free
            flow of energy. This can be great for athletes, general fatigue
            symptoms, and pain syndromes.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3 class="subcat">Tui Na</h3>
          <p class="long-copy">
            Tui Na is a therapeutic form of massage that has been used in
            China for more than 5,000 years. Tui Na has many different forms
            from “rolling” to “kneading,” “grasping,” and even “one finger
            meditation." All is based on a person’s needs, all Tui Na is
            individualized to accommodate their needs.
